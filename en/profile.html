			<h1>Yay, hello!</h1>
			<p>
				My full name is <strong>Masahiko AMANO</strong>. As seen, the name is
				Japanese and in original spells <strong lang="jp">天人楽彦</strong>.
				However, this name seems to be rather long to write or pronounce so if
				lazy just call me my nickname <strong>H1K0</strong> (pronouncing
				<i>hiko</i>).
			</p>
			<p>
				First of all, I'm a musician. From the age of 3 or 4 I often played on
				my mom's old synthesizer, then at the age of 6 I attended into a music
				school and at the age of 7 I composed my first piece — a simple piano
				waltz. At the age of 10 I started playing the guitar and trying to
				compose pop songs. Then, I graduated with honors from music school at
				the age of 13, knew about DAW and started making electronic music. Three
				years later, that's when I was 16, my friend and I formed the duo
				<a href="https://zingers.xyz">ZingerS</a> and the problem of lyrics
				seemed to be almost solved for me. A few more time passed, and shortly
				before my eighteenth birthday it was made very clear for me that for
				almost all the previous time I'd been just marking time. So, since then
				I began to try myself in other various genres and styles, moreover I
				also started studying mixing and mastering.
			</p>
			<p>Also I'm a photographer since the age of 17.</p>
