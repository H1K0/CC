    <h1>Yay, hello!</h1>
    <p>My full name is <strong>Masahiko AMANO</strong>. As seen, the name is Japanese and in original spells <strong>天人楽彦</strong>. The first name <i>Masahiko</i> consist of kanji (symbols) meaning «joy» and «prince» so get used to me calling myself <em>Prince of Joy</em>. Moreover, the name is rather long to write or pronounce so if lazy just call me my nickname <strong>H1K0</strong> (pronouncing <i>hiko</i>).</p>
    <p>So, as a real Prince of Joy, I enjoy my life a lot!</p>
    <p>Lots of talents having, lots of different ways enjoying.</p>
    <h2>Let's start with music</h2>
    <p>I'm not mistaken saying I'm in music since I was born. My mum once said that as a baby I couldn't sleep without music.</p>
    <p>And now I'm kinda professional composer and arranger making mostly <em>light</em> music using FL Studio DAW.</p>
    <p>Btw «light» is actually my favorite English word as long as it has meanings of «bright», «positive» and «light(weight)».</p>
    <p>Also I'm a member of synthpop-duet <a href="http://h1k0.github.io/ZingerS" target="_blank"><strong>ZingerS</strong></a>. It was created on January 28, 2019, when my friend Mike Allen sent me the lyrics for our first song <a href="http://h1k0.github.io/ZingerS/en/music/singles/stay_alive" target="_blank">«Stay Alive»</a> (released December 6, 2019). My roles in the duet: composer, arranger, programmer, lead and back vocalist and song cover designer.</p>
    <p>All my music is presented on the <a href="music">music page</a>.</p>
    <h2>Now about photo</h2>
    <p>My first camera I got as a present from parents when graduated from first grade of primary school. But the real interest came in August 2019 when I lented parents' camera. :3</p>
    <p>As seen on the <a href="photo">photo page</a>, I love taking colorful and surreal photos. In general, interesting ones.</p>
    <h2>After photos, of course, video</h2>
    <p>At first all videos I made were just simple MVs consisting of only image on the background, the song title and jumping audio spectrum.</p>
    <p>But as the times change people change too so now I'm trying to make films and full-fledged MV.</p>
    <h2>Concluding graphics and proceeding to articles</h2>
    <p>Well. Talking about articles, I write them so much so I don't remember my first one: what it was about and when I wrote it. The topic can be anything as long as it's interesting and I write just on inspiration without thinking hard.</p>
    <p>It's fully seen on the <a href="articles">articles page</a>.</p>
    <p>Btw I didn't mark the link to the <a href="video">video page</a>. Better late than never. :3</p>
    <h2>And finally novels</h2>
    <p>Novels, yeah...</p>
    <p>My first experience in fiction was as soon as I learned to write. Just something like a story about cavy.</p>
    <p>Then as long as I'm a super-perfectionist, I think of every word and punctuation mark while writing and cuz of this abandoned many interesting ideas. A leak of experience. There's no doubt perfectionism is an advantage but sometimes it just acts like a disadvantage too...</p>
    <p>Nevertheless, On April 14, 2019, on the fourth anniversary of my pro-composer and arranger career, I finally completed and published the first chapter of the «ISEKAI» series. Well, actually, it's size is no more than an epigraph but, as it said, well begun is half done.</p>
    <h2>My life energy keeps growing up so it's gonna be more and more fun!</h2>
