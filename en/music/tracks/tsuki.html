The next day, August 16th, I wrote the lyrics and the very next day recorded the <a href="https://www.newgrounds.com/audio/listen/878562" target="_blank">preview</a>.</p><p>IROSEKA is the first sing song that I made whole by myself. My first song at all is <a href="https://zingers.xyz/en/music/singles/stay_alive" target="_blank">Stay Alive</a>, but the lyrics for it weren't made by me, so IROSEKA is kinda more important and valuable for me.</p><p><br></p><p>So, to such an important and valuable song by and for me, this track is dedicated.</p><p>Do you remember? This year on April 14th I published <a href="arashi" target="_blank">嵐</a> — the first completed song from the album <a href="https://h1k0.newgrounds.com/news/post/1093067" target="_blank">花嵐月雪</a>. Today this album is supplemented with this track called <strong>月</strong>.</p><p>月 <em>(tsuki)</em> means <strong>the moon</strong>. If saying about moon, it's silent, still and static (btw in Japanese all these three words contain kanji 静 "silence"). So I made this track representing these words.</p><p>I started making this 4 days ago, August 11th. Firstly I was gonna make it in a kinda full-fledged multiinstrumental arrangement but this way it'd sound less moon-likely, so finally I decided to make it solo instrument.</p><p>The music material for this I collected from the recordings of my piano improvisations, so the whole working time in FL turned out to be less than 5 hours.</p><p>And here the reasonable question pops up: why so long if all I needed was just to copy the music from recordings to piano roll? Yeah, the rest time I was creating the instrument itself. For this track I needed an EP-like sounding synth, but somehow I wasn't satisfied with any, so I ended up creating my own using FM8.</p><p><br></p><p>Btw, as this track is solo instrument and I had a lot of spare time, I made a <a href="https://yadi.sk/i/x51qVw2JAQ-rrQ" target="_blank">musical score</a> for it. You can use it for the piano practice or just to play it yourself and calm down listening to it.</p></div>
